	Hello there! My name's Yahya Rissouni, and today I'll be discussing with you the process of Caramelization,<br>
    it's importance and types! I hope you've enjoyed this sleek presentation by the way! Firstly: Caramelization,<br>
    otherwise known as the process of heating sugar is, as I've said just now, is the " Heating " of a sugar compound!<br>
    (such as granulated white sugar or the sugar contained in a food) ( It's used to enrich the flavour of a dish!)<br>
    at high temperature so that water is removed and the sugar is broken down (as into glucose and fructose) <br>
    and then reformed into complex polymers producing a sweet, nutty, <br>
    or buttery flavor and golden-brown to dark brown</br></h3></b></p></font>

<font face="Ink Free"><h3 align="left"><p style="color:white"><b>
	Caramelization is one of the most important types of browning processes in foods,<br>
    together with Maillard reactions and enzymatic browning. Carmelization leads desirable colour and flavour in bakery's<br>
    goods, coffee, beverages, beer and peanuts. Undesirable effects of caramelization are for example burned sugar smell and blackening.<br> 
    Caramelization causes important changes in foods, not only in colour but also in flavour. As no enzymes are involved in the carmelization process,<br> 
    it is a non-enzymatic browning reaction. Caramelization occurs during dry heating and roasting of foods with a high concentration of carbohydrates<br>
    (sugars).</br></b></h3></p></font>

<font face="Ink Free"><h3 align="left"><p style="color:white"><b>
    The process of caramelization starts with the melting of the sugar at high temperatures, followed by foaming (boiling).<br>
    At this stage saccharose (sugar) decomposes into glucose and fructose. This is followed by a condensation step, in which the individual sugars<br> 
    lose water and react with each other to for example difructose-anhydride. The next step is the isomerization of aldoses to ketoses and further dehydration reactions.<br> 
    The last series of reactions include both fragmentation reactions (flavour production) and polymerization reactions (colour production). Caramelization starts at relatively high<br>
    temperatures as compared to the other browning reactions, and depends on the type of sugar. Table 1 below shows the initial caramelization temperatures of some common carbohydrates.<br> 
    This table is based on pure carbohydrates. In foods often several different carbohydrates and other components are present; all these may influence the caramelization temperature as<br>
    well as the different steps and reactions, and thus the final flavours and colours that are produced.</br></b></h3></p></font>

<font face="Ink Free"><h3 align="left"><p style="color:white"><b>
    The highest rate of the colour development is caused by fructose as caramelization of fructose starts at lower temperature.<br>
    Baked goods made from honey or fructose syrup thus are generally a bit darker than those made with sugar.<br>

    During caramelization several flavour components as well as polymeric caramels are produced.<br> 
    Caramels are complex mixture of various high molecular weight components.<br>
    They can be classified into three groups:<br>
    <!--Space is Vital: B--><br>
    1. Caramelans (C24H36O18)<br>
    2. Caramelens (C36H50O25)<br>
    3. Caramelins (C125H188O80)</br></b></h3></p></font>
